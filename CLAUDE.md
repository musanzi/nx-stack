# Repository guidelines

## Project structure

This pnpm and Nx monorepo manages KBM exhibitor participation. Use these directories:

- `apps/api/src/modules/`: NestJS feature modules with CQRS handlers, DTOs, and TypeORM entities. Put database migrations in `apps/api/src/modules/database/migrations/`.
- `apps/web/src/app/`: Angular portals organized into `domains/`, `core/`, and `shared/`. Keep state and data access separate from presentational UI.
- `apps/web/public/`: static assets. Put custom styles in `apps/web/src/styles/`.
- `libs/api-contracts/`: generated OpenAPI schema and types. Import types through `@kbm-exhibitors/api-contracts`.

## Code style and naming

Use two-space indentation, single quotes, and semicolons. Prettier uses a 120-character print width and omits trailing commas. Follow ESLint and Angular template accessibility rules.

Don't write comments in code. Give classes, methods, and functions clear names instead.

Use kebab-case filenames, PascalCase classes, and camelCase members. Follow neighboring modules and filenames, such as `create-stand.handler.ts`. Use kebab-case for Angular component selectors and camelCase for directive selectors.

For frontend implementation, use the angular-developer skill.

## API testing

- Run `pnpm test:api` after API behavior changes. The unit suite requires no environment file or running services.
- Run `pnpm test:api:watch` while editing, or `pnpm test:api --args=validate-credentials` to filter specs by path.
- Run `pnpm typecheck:api:tests` to check specs, fixtures, and runner configuration. `pnpm typecheck` also includes this check.
- Place `*.spec.ts` files beside the code under test and import Vitest functions explicitly. Use Nest testing modules for dependency-injected providers and call exported helpers directly.
- Test observable outcomes and consequential side effects, including effects that must not occur after failure. Mock infrastructure dependencies and keep business logic under test.
- Add regression tests for bug fixes. Skip construction-only tests and tests of methods that only forward a call. No numeric coverage threshold applies.

## Commits and pull requests

Use a Conventional Commit prefix, such as `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor(web):`, or `docs:`. Follow it with a concise description. Commitlint enforces this format. The pre-commit hook runs lint.

In pull requests, describe the problem, the resulting behavior, and how you checked the changes. Link relevant issues. Include screenshots for visual changes.

## Running servers

The user keeps the development stack running in Docker with `compose.dev.yml`: web on port 4200 (`WEB_PORT`) and API on port 8000. Do not run `pnpm dev`, `pnpm dev:api`, `pnpm dev:web`, `nx serve`, or `docker compose up`, because a second copy of the stack can exhaust the machine's memory. To check behavior, send requests to the running servers with curl. If a server you need is down, ask the user to start it. To validate a change, run `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, or `pnpm test:api` instead of a build.
